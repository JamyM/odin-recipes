    <p>Bulalo is a rustic soup that uses a long simmering of bone marrow bones with corn, potatoes and cabbage to create a delicate, yet complex flavor profile. Bulalo is a specialty dish in a region of the Phillippines that is best known for their beef cattle.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>5 pounds beef shanks, preferably grass-fed</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole garlic cloves (about 10) smashed with the side of a knife</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 medium white onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups coarsly chopped peeled potatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 pound napa cabbage, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ear fresh corn, cut cross wise into 1-inch-long pieces</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
    </uo>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large stockpot, bring 1 gallon water to a boil</li>
        <li>Season the beef shanks liberally with salt and pepper. Add them to the boiling water and let the water come back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the water simmers. Skim off any impurities from the top.</li>
        <li>Add the peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves, and onions and cook the beef shanks for 2 1/3 to 3 1/2 hours, until the marrow is tender. Keep an eye on the pot. Add water as needed to keep the ingredients just covered.</li>
        <li>Add the scallions, potatoes, cabbage, and corn and cook for 10 minutes more, or until the potatoes are cooked through. Taste and season with fish sauce.</li>
        <li> Serve in deep bowls, making sure each serving has some beef, onion, potato, cabbage, and corn.</li>
    </ol>

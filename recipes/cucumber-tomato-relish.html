    <p>This simple salad recipe or "ensalada" is treated as a condiment when accompanying dishes in the Phillippines. The coolness of the cucumbers and tomatoes adds freshness to salty grilled meats and adobo. Adding a bit of this relish to bites of the main dish gives an additional layer of texture and flavor</p>

    <p><em>Note:</em> This recipe is from <u>I Am A Filipino</u> by Nicole Ponseca and Miguel Trinidad</p>

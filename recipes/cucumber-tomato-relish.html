    <p><em>Note:</em> This recipe is from <u>I Am A Filipino</u> by Nicole Ponseca and Miguel Trinidad</p>

    <p>This simple salad recipe or "ensalada" is treated as a condiment when accompanying dishes in the Phillippines. The coolness of the cucumbers and tomatoes adds freshness to salty grilled meats and adobo. Adding a bit of this relish to bites of the main dish gives an additional layer of texture and flavor</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>1 cucumber, quartered, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, diced, or 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
    </uo>

    <p>In a bowl, combine the cucumber, tomato, cilantro, onion, fish sauce, and lemon juice. Serve right away.</p>
